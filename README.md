# **HangMan Game**



[The HangMan Game](https://noeliaci.github.io/Hangman-Game/) is an online old school game where the goal is
 to find the missing word by guessing letters. The game has three different categories to choose from: Animals, Music Bands
 and Instruments. The player can guess a letter by clicking on it. The game finishes when the player has correctly guessed 
all the letters or when all six body parts are on the gallows.
